# Security best practices in Amazon API Gateway

Mystique Corp us buiding a stealth p-kon app. This app is a containerized microservice made of many APIs. As the app handles Personally Identifiable Information(PII) data, they intend to secure their api and do not want to expose it to the internet. Ideally the APIs should be accessible from within their own corporate networks only; All other access to the APIs should be denied.

The following picture represents a sample public api, that is to be avoided.

To achieve this enhanced security, We can deploy the api as an `PRIVATE` endpoint. Amazon API Gateway private endpoints enable you to build private API‚Äìbased services inside your own VPCs. You can now keep both the frontend to your API (API Gateway) and the backend service (Lambda, EC2, ECS, etc.) private inside your VPC. In additon to these, we can also add a security group to our APIs to restrict them access from certain IP/Ports.

In this article, we will build the above architecture. using Cloudformation generated using [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)][102]. The architecture has been designed in a modular way so that we can build them individually and integrate them together. The prerequisites to build this architecture are listed below

1. ## üß∞ Prerequisites

   This demo, instructions, scripts and cloudformation template is designed to be run in `us-east-1`. With few modifications you can try it out in other regions as well(_Not covered here_).

   - üõ† AWS CLI Installed & Configured - [Get help here](https://youtu.be/TPyyfmQte0U)
   - üõ† AWS CDK Installed & Configured - [Get help here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwxpszw0Rc)
   - üõ† Python Packages, _Change the below commands to suit your OS, the following is written for amzn linux 2_
     - Python3 - `yum install -y python3`
     - Python Pip - `yum install -y python-pip`
     - Virtualenv - `pip3 install virtualenv`

1. ## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting up the environment

   - Get the application code

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/miztiik/secure-private-api.git
     cd secure-private-api
     ```

1. ## üöÄ Prepare the dev environment to run AWS CDK

   We will cdk to be installed to make our deployments easier. Lets go ahead and install the necessary components.

   ```bash
   # If you DONT have cdk installed
   npm install -g aws-cdk

   # Make sure you in root directory
   python3 -m venv .env
   source .env/bin/activate
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   The very first time you deploy an AWS CDK app into an environment _(account/region)_, you‚Äôll need to install a `bootstrap stack`, Otherwise just go ahead and deploy using `cdk deploy`.

   ```bash
   cdk bootstrap
   cdk ls
   # Follow on screen prompts
   ```

   You should see an output of the available stacks,

   ```bash
   unsecure-public-api
   secure-private-api-vpc-stack
   secure-private-api
   api-consumer
   ```

1. ## üöÄ Deploying the application

   Let us walk through each of the stacks,

   - **Stack: unsecure-public-api**
     We are going to deploy a simple `greeter` api. This API is deployed as public endpoing to illustrate that any one in the internet can access the API and it is unsecure. When the api is invoked, It returns a welcome message along with the lambda ip address. We should be able to invoke the function from a browser or using an utility like `curl`.

     Initiate the deployment with the following command,

     ```bash
     cdk deploy unsecure-public-api
     ```

     _Expected output:_
     The `ApiUrl` can be found in the outputs section of the stack,

     ```json
     {
       "message": "Hi Miztikal World, Hello from Lambda running at 3.237.174.199"
     }
     ```

   - **Stack: secure-private-api**

     Now that we have understand that public APIs are accessible by everyone. Let us see how to build an secure API. To secure the API, we are going to deploy as `PRIVATE` type API and make it accessible only from a custom VPC. To add another layer of security, we can have a custom defined security group attached to the API.

     This stack:_secure-private-api_ is dependant on the `secure-private-api-vpc-stack`. If you are using CDK, it will be deployed for you. If not go ahead and deploy that as well. The following resources are created by these two stacks,

     - A Custom VPC ( without NAT Instances )
       - API Gateway VPCE Endpoint
       - Custom Security Group allowing port `443` from within the VPC
     - Deploy an API Gateway with an lambda function backend
       - Attach a API Gateway Resource Policy, to make the API accessible only from the VPC


        Initiate the deployment with the following command,

        ```bash
        cdk deploy secure-private-api-vpc-stack
        cdk deploy secure-private-api
        ```

        Check the `Outputs` section of the stack to access the `SecureApiUrl`

1.  ## üî¨ Testing the solution

    The _Outputs_ section of the `secure-private-api` stack has the required information on the urls

    - We need to invoke the `SecureApiUrl` from the same VPC. To make it easier to test the solution, I have created another template that will deploy an EC2 instance in the same VPC and in the same security group as the API Gateway. You can login to the instances using [Systems Manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASMtZBrx-k). You can deploy this stack or create your own instance.

      Initiate the deployment with the following command,

      ```bash
      cdk deploy api-consumer
      ```

      ```bash
      curl -X GET https://p35nrnhb3m.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/miztiik/secure/greeter
      ```

      Expected Output,

      ```bash
      sh-4.2$ curl -X GET https://p35nrnhb3m.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/miztiik/secure/greeter
      {"message": "Hi Miztikal World, Hello from Lambda running at 3.235.133.156"}
      ```

      You can try accessing the `SecureApiUrl` from your browser/postman tool/`curl`, you should get an error. Here is an example from curl,

      ```bash
      $ curl https://p35nrnhb3m.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/miztiik/secure/greeter
      curl: (6) Could not resolve host: p35nrnhb3m.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
      ```

      Whereas if you do an `nslookup {SecureApiUrl_Domain}` in the EC2 instance, you will get an successful response from the [VPC DNS Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html#AmazonDNS#:~:text=the%20DNS%20Server%20on%20a%2010.0.0.0/16%20network%20is%20located%20at%2010.0.0.2).

      ```bash
      sh-4.2$ nslookup p35nrnhb3m.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
      Server:         10.10.0.2
      Address:        10.10.0.2#53

      Non-authoritative answer:
      p35nrnhb3m.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com  canonical name = execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com.
      Name:   execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
      Address: 10.10.2.13
      Name:   execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
      Address: 10.10.3.160
      ```

    Now that we have shown how to deploy an API and secure it using API Gateway resource policies, VPC Endpoints & Security Groups.

    _Additional Learnings:_ You can check the logs in cloudwatch for more information or increase the logging level of the lambda functions by changing the environment variable from `INFO` to `DEBUG`

1)  ## üßπ CleanUp

    If you want to destroy all the resources created by the stack, Execute the below command to delete the stack, or _you can delete the stack from console as well_

    - Resources created during deployment
    - Delete CloudWatch Lambda LogGroups
    - _Any other custom resources, you have created for this demo_

    ```bash
    # Delete from cdk
    cdk destroy {STACK_NAMES}

    # Follow any on-screen prompts

    # Delete the CF Stack, If you used cloudformation to deploy the stack.
    aws cloudformation delete-stack \
        --stack-name "MiztiikAutomationStack" \
        --region "${AWS_REGION}"
    ```

    This is not an exhaustive list, please carry out other necessary steps as maybe applicable to your needs.
